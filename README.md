Implemented python libraries to perform extensive data analysis on Forbesâ€™ 2019 US College ranking dataset.

Cleaned, manipulated, and visualized data to compare different numerical and categorical features of data.

Created linear regression models to highlight relationships between key numerical features in the data to find essential patterns.

Found a negative 0.72 correlation between rank and alumni average salary and 0.63 negative correlation between rank and acceptance rate.
